Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations, the chance of winning varies greatly.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
at around 10000 simulations, winning chances of top teams are within 1% deviation
