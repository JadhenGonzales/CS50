danceability is 0.7
energy is 0.6
valence is 0.5

I would characterize the listener as having a purple aura, having relatively high danceability and energy.

This just uses the top 100 songs of a listener over a given year. I would rather calculate the aura per given listening session then
calculate the prevalent aura over the year.
